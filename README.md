# OpenML Frontend
This is a novel standalone frontend for OpenML, built on Flask, React, and Dash.

## Building
The app can be built by running

`npm run debug`

## How to contribute
We welcome all contributions to:
* Style and layout
* Data visualizations
* Search functionality
* Bugfixes and open issues

If you want to contribute new features, or you need additional functionality from the OpenML server, please open an issue.

## OpenML Server interaction
The frontend mainly works on data from an ElasticSearch index of OpenML data.
Additional interactions with an OpenML backend (e.g. dataset upload) go via the [OpenML REST API](https://www.openml.org/api_docs)

## Help
This code is currently underdocumented. We are working on this. Feel very free to open issues to ask questions!
