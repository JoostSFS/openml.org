# OpenML Frontend
This is a novel standalone frontend for OpenML, built on Flask, React, and Dash.

## Getting started
Please see the [Website documentation](https://docs.openml.org/Website/) for installation instructions and further information on structure and guidelines.

## How to contribute
We welcome all contributions to:
* Style and layout
* Data visualizations
* Search functionality
* Bugfixes and open issues

If you want to contribute new features, or you need additional functionality from the OpenML server, please open an issue.

## OpenML Server interaction
The frontend mainly works on data from an ElasticSearch index of OpenML data.
Additional interactions with an OpenML backend (e.g. dataset upload) go via the [OpenML Python API](https://openml.github.io/openml-python/master/)

## Help
This code is currently underdocumented. We are working on this. Feel very free to open issues to ask questions!
